                    <p>the first sign to the outer world that there was something wrong came at a power plant in Sweden on 28 April 1986. A chemist responsible for measuring radiation levels noticed what seemed like a malfunction: the alarm kept going off. He examined the shoe of a co-worker. It showed radioactive elements not normally detected at the plant. The Swedes immediately suspected a Soviet accident. It took many days before anyone knew that something very bad had happened 1,500km away in Chernobyl, Ukraine.</p>
